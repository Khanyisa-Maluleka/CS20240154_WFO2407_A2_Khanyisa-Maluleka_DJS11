Netlify link : <https://674b85b8a64b3c96f969bae5--cheery-phoenix-e4bc4b.netlify.app/>

**Set-up**
The project started off with the installation of react libraries, via `npm install create@latest`
I cloned a repo from Github and navigated to the directory I wanted to work in
I did `npm  install` for all other libraries that I did not have, like my json packages
In order to run the code, I ran `npm run dev`, and it gave me a link to the webpage

**How to use**
-The project has been deployed to netlify, you just have to click the link that is included at the top of the page
-If you wanna run locally, you have to - 1. Navigate to the directory the code is in
                                         2. Run `npm run dev`
-Then click on the link you see

**Dependecies**
Some other libraries I installed are `nmp infuse.js` and one for the carousel

**Problems**
The code only filters show by genre id, and not the specific gender type
